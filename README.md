## Adviced Structure of Dataset Folder

For the ease of Training and Implementation flow, following structure would be adviced :-

```
|--Dataset Folder

   |--X_Ray_Train

      |--COVID
      |--Non_COVID

   |--X_Ray_Test

      |--COVID
      |--Non_COVID

   |--CT_Scan_Train

      |--COVID
      |--Non_COVID

   |--CT_Scan_Test

      |--COVID
      |--Non_COVID

```
